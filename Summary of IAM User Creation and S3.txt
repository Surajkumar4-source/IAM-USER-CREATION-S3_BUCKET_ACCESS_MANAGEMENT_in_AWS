Summary of IAM User Creation and S3 Access Management Task

This task involves creating two IAM users with different levels of S3 access permissions and testing their ability to interact with an S3 bucket.

Step 1: Create IAM Users
Mike (S3 Full Access):

- Create a user named Mike with both Programmatic and AWS Management Console access.
- Assign the AmazonS3FullAccess policy to Mike.
- Save Mike's credentials.


Create a user named Sam with both Programmatic and AWS Management Console access.

- Assign the AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess policy to Sam.
- Save Sam's credentials.


Step 2: Create an S3 Bucket

- Create an S3 bucket (e.g., mike-sam-test-bucket-12345) with a unique name and a chosen region (e.g., us-east-1).
- Step 3: Test Access for Mike (Full Access)
- Log in as Mike using the credentials.
- Navigate to the S3 console and verify Mike can access the bucket.
- Mike should be able to upload files to the bucket due to Full Access permissions.



Step 4: Test Access for Sam (Read-Only Access)

- Log in as Sam using the credentials.
- Navigate to the S3 console and verify Sam can access the bucket.
- Sam can view and download files, but cannot upload due to Read-Only permissions.



Step 5: Verify Permissions

- Mike can upload, delete, and view files in the bucket.
- Sam can only view and download files, unable to upload or modify content in the bucket.


Step 6: Clean Up (Optional)

- Delete the S3 bucket if no longer needed.
- Remove the IAM users (Mike and Sam) from the IAM console.


Conclusion:

Mike has full access and can upload files to the S3 bucket.
Sam has read-only access and can only view and download files, unable to upload any content.
